Noel is a 4’1 satyr with brown hair and a brown beard, both with graying ends

He dances and plays his flute for the patrons of the tavern

He comes to town on occasion, but nobody really knows where he’s from or where he goes.

He’s a thief, and lulls people to sleep before stealing their shit

His house is in the woods, and is a quaint cottage with a lush garden.

He has struck a peace with the cultists where he pretends to be a follower and tithes so that they don’t brutally murder him and raze his house like they did his neighbors.
