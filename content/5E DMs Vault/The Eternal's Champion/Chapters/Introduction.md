The Kingdom of Eternia is abuzz with rumors about the mysterious disappearance of Lady Freya Richard the Determined. The King’s chosen champion and advisor—renowned for her discipline and generosity—is beloved by the citizenry and theories abound about her capture or untimely demise.

While Lady Freya has been known to embark on clandestine missions under strict confidence, the nobility quickly picked up on the palpable unease filtering down through the King’s court in recent months. See, uncertainty is uncommon in a realm ruled by an immortal.

King Godless, may he forever reign, assumed the throne of the small Kingdom of Atrea from his uncle shortly after his 23rd birthday, 641 years ago. In the time since, through the King’s skilled diplomacy and martial leadership, the Kingdom expanded to become an unrivalled exporter of culture and influence abroad. No nations dare challenge its sovereignty.

Lady Freya’s role in the Kingdom’s continued success is unquestionable. No living generation of Eternians has experienced a world in which Lady Freya’s influence was not felt. From freeing captives taken by bandits to negotiating international trade deals, her contributions to the Kingdom are as varied as they are numerous. While not as old as King Godless, any question about when she began her service is met with a wry smile and a reproach that “a lady never discusses her age.” Somehow, she charms even in prevarication.

So, it came as little surprise when word came down that King Godless had ordered the assembly of a militia to sail to the undisclosed location of Lady Freya’s last mission. Any person who survived and returned Lady Freya safely would be paid a handsome sum, and any person who completed her secret mission would be paid quintuple and granted eternal favor by the King. The Criers, of course, did not have any information on what that mission was.

Our party consists of volunteers for that militia. Upon answering the call, the party, along with dozens of other volunteers, were herded onto one of two large ships destined for an undisclosed location. Two weeks have passed, and all maps indicate another two will pass before making landfall. Our story begins here, asea.
