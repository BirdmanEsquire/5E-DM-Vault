# Part 1 - The Unassailable

A 120-foot tall ship effortlessly cuts through the waves in the open ocean. Flags waving from the masts bear the crest of the Kingdom of Eternia in bright blue and gold, and the gilt name “Unassailable” shimmers across the starboard fore.

Packed inside the hold are a diverse group of adventurers ranging from the well-equipped professional to the rag-tag amateur, all who answered the call to save Lady Freya the Determined. These strangers, despite being crammed in a wooden box for two weeks, are generally collegial—perhaps because of the good food and drink that seems to magically resupply itself, and the ability to freely move about the large, luxurious deck. That said, everyone is a little antsy to get where they’re going, wherever that is.

Abovedeck, a group of volunteers and sailors have been taking in the air and watching the thick fog settle on the open ocean. Visibility has dropped dramatically, and you can just make out the lamps hanging on the other ship. The apparent leader of this expeditionary force, a tall human woman wearing Eternian colors named Captain Fiberwight, stands above you on the bridge next to the helmsman. Atop the center mast in the crows nest stands a vigilant young person and next to its base are two men engaged in a jolly conversation. [Party](https://www.notion.so/Party-16fa37ab06c4457d817f14c189d399b0?pvs=21) [introductions]

Suddenly, out of the mist, you see a large shadow emerge, which quickly reveals itself as a third ship—a sculpted metal dragon mounted to its bow. Fiberwight shouts “BRACE!” but you don’t have time to move before the dragon smashes through the side of your ship and pierces halfway in before getting lodged and settling. Three menacing figures leap aboard the Unassailable through the dust and the fog. ROLL FOR INITIATIVE.

# Part 2 - The Mountain Pass

As the dust settles, you realize you are now stuck on a sinking ship far from land. You have lost sight of the other Eternian ship. What do you do?

You feel a sudden lurching, (dex saving throw?)

Over the side you see a sheer cliff with a beach along its base. Looking down the beach about a mile you just make out a pier in the fog.

### Fishing Village

- mysterious figure enters house
- empty houses that look abandoned
    - Loot? Clues?
- Other ship (the “Peerless”) is anchored in the bay. Rowboats carrying volunteers have landed near the village.
    - Captain Bergenfels is leader of other group. He wears the same regalia as Fiberwight, but he is a broad-chested man with wavy, silver hair. He looks and acts like he’s on vacation.
- Fiberwight insists on pressing up the mountain path

### Gate

- 2x shield guardians
- Wizard on the bridge over the gate [Zorion Bersa](https://www.notion.so/Zorion-Bersa-0e5d72445ebe4833867a2300f985f643?pvs=21)
- Crossbowmen atop the towers

Wizard asks that the party prove they will help the people of this land by eliminating the pirate menace in their lair.

Being back the stolen ring to prove it

### Pirate lair

Encounter 1:

- Immediately inside the entrance to the cave is a large chamber divided in half with a slapdash wall made of piled-up wood and stone. Behind the wall you hear screams of terror punctuated with joyful laughter. The coppery smell of blood assaults your senses, and streaks of blood mix with dirt to form a trail toward a ship’s door installed on the wall. A pirate on his last legs is leaned up next to the door, his gut sliced wide open and his hands and legs covered in a deep crimson. Sloan sprints up to the near-lifeless body and shouts “Thrash! Talk to me thrash!” but gets only moans in response. He falls back and holds his head in his hands in desperation.
- [Investigation] The wall is constructed from bits of flotsam and jetsam, as well as stones pulled from the cave floor. Near the ceiling small gaps remain, and you see the flickering of candlelight and the movement of shadows behind the wall.
- Solutions:
    - Explosive barrels on other side of wall can be lit
    - Force door open with hard strength check
    - Shrink down and go to other side of wall
    - Heal pirate and he will help
- Behind the wall is a kind of storage room where the pirates keep their ill-gotten gains. It’s a mess of boxes and loose knock-knacks, and some of the boxes in the back are covered with dust and cobwebs. A pulley system across the ceiling suspends fishing nets packed with crates and jars. Two large barrels are tucked up against the makeshift wall—one labeled “rum” and the other labeled “oil”.
- You see a man in a black cloak with a metal mask in the shape of a rat’s face standing over the body of the pirate captain. He is slashing wildly at the lifeless body, and mumbling indecipherably to himself. Two pirate crewmen lay lifeless on the ground nearby. He looks up, startled, and notices you, then scrambles deeper into the cave, down a narrow passageway.

Encounter 2:

- The cave twists and winds downward, and makeshift torches light your way. You come to a split in the cave—one passage to the right and another to the left.
    
- [Spiders] - This path takes a short jaunt around a corner before opening into a large chamber. The space is dark, but a dim green light is emitted by pools of bubbling green goo on the cave floor. Against the far wall you notice an enticing wooden chest.
    
    - You see massive webs across the ceiling and smell rotting flesh. As you scan the stalagmites and the dark reaches beyond a spinning white mass catches your eye. Your eyes adjust and you realize what you are looking at—a giant spider is hard at work wrapping a suspended corpse in its web. Unfortunately, it notices you as well. [Roll for initiative]
    - 2x Wolf spiders
    - 1x Giant spider (20 initiative - opens with webbing ability)

- In chest - 25 gp, silver ewer (25gp), gold locket (25gp)
    

Encounter 3:

- Down this path you see the mysterious man run deeper into the cave. As he turns a corner he slashes at a rope, tied to a mooring on the wall. The rope whips into the air and a mass of boxes, jars, and stones that had been suspended above crashes to the ground, blocking the path. Left of the settling rubble you see the cave descend into deep blackness.
- Behind the rubble you see an undamaged box that looks like it may contain something valuable
- In the dark you see a spring that appears to flow away. A massive frog (giant toad) sits in the water, and you see the faint flickering of light behind the frog, but he blocks the way
- Solutions:
    - Talk to the frog and convince him to move
    - Find fish in the barrels in the prior room to lure the frog away
    - Kill the frog (but he has a friend)
    - Blow up the rubble
- 2x Potion of healing in the rubble
- [Spiders and Frogs](https://www.notion.so/Spiders-and-Frogs-6ef0af98e58c4de4b40b796957e3f49f?pvs=21)

Encounter 4:

- You step into daylight as you emerge into an enormous cavern. A rocky roof spans hundreds of feet overhead, and blue ocean water calmly heaves in a pool wide and deep enough to dock the pirate’s ship. Cots, campfires, and supplies dot the shore around the pool, and a roughly-assembled dock juts out into the sheltered lagoon. You see the robed man scrambling to untie a boat from the dock when he notices you and quickly stands, trying to compose himself. He shouts across the lagoon…
    
    - His name is Rafael, but people call him Ted
    - What do you want—you’re not supposed to be here. You’re messing everything up.
    - 1x Cult Fanatic + 4x Cultists (with 6 PCs)
    
    [Seaside Cave Creatures](https://www.notion.so/Seaside-Cave-Creatures-c21c8064b7ca474f95dac08fb15357e8?pvs=21)
    
- Find a pair of engraved bone dice (25 gp) in the camp
    
- Ted has a [Cloak of Billowing](https://www.thievesguild.cc/magicitems/magic-item?id=351) on his body
    
- Large gold bracelet (250 gp), a wooden box with a brilliant pearl inside (250gp), and a key tied to a black feather in chest
    

# Part 2.B - Lazav Catches Up

The wizard Zorion Bersa sits atop a parapet on the Great Terran Gate beneath which a messy militia mingles unhurriedly. He yawns, and looks at the top of his wrist from which bright runes are projected, telling him the time. He then looks down at the tall, half-elf paladin admiring one of two giant, animated suits of armor flanking the gate.

Following a lengthy debate about the virtues of Lady Freya Richard with Captain Fiberwight (which undoubtedly was not at all tedious and in fact, probably quite enjoyable for her), Lazav’s attention was drawn by the tightly woven mail on the suits of armor, and the shining steel plates that seemed to twinkle as if inlaid with tiny diamonds. He feels a tap on his shoulder, and turns to see Biggs the blacksmith, who says, “I’m starting to get concerned about your friends. They have been gone for quite a while now, and there’s a huge plume of smoke rising up from the direction they headed.” Lazav looks out toward the sea and sees just that—billowing black smoke is emerging from the side of a cliff back down the mountain path towards the ships.

# Part 3.C - New poison encounter

This path takes a short jaunt around a corner before opening into a large chamber. The space is dark, but a dim green light is emitted by pools of bubbling green goo on the cave floor. Against the far wall you notice an enticing wooden chest.

- The green pool closest to you starts to bubble, and as the bubbles burst they emit a noxious fog. Then, one large bubble appears and explodes. Everyone in a tile adjacent to the pool takes 1d4+1 poison damage and must pass a constitution saving throw (DC 12) or be poisoned. If in the poison, take 1d4 poison damage per turn and same constitution saving throw.

Roll for which pool spits each round

# Part 3 - Into Gateside

As the party turns the corner at the top of the mountain path, they notice that the volunteers’ camp is gone, and the gate hangs open. The towering metal men remain vigilant, and the crossbowmen eye you as you approach. The wizard Zorian leans up against the left door, visibly shaken.

When you cross the threshold, you are greeted with an incredible view of a valley that descends before you and spans far into the distance. Looking Northward, a mountain ridge rises up just at the edge of the horizon and curves around to the east before joining with the seaside cliffs you just climbed. To the west the mountains drop away into the thick fog that blankets the valley below. In the center of the valley rises one majestic peak, around which swirl thin streams of a mist that appears to emit a blue-green glow.

As you step further along the path you also see blue and red rooftops stepped directly in front of you on terraces. A not-so-modest town appears to have been erected just below the gate and watches over the valley from its mountainside perch. You hear bustling to your left and see the volunteers have moved their camp just inside the gate and are setting up for a more permanent stay. Bergenfels walks over, pipe hanging out of his mouth, slaps Gwynevere on the back and says “Look what they’ve been hiding from us. Isn’t it magnificent?”
