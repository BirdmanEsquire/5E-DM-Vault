# Volunteer Camp

The other volunteers appear to have thrown together a sizeable camp in short order in a clearing just beyond the gate. Small, two-person tents have been neatly arranged in lines for sleeping, and a circle of larger tents is grouped around a sizeable bonfire. Out of one of the larger tents you see a chimney arise and white smoke is billowing out. Smells like ribs. Biggs is arranging his blacksmithing tools around the tent next to it, and outside the next tent down Fiberwight is furiously scrawling notes on a giant piece of paper set upon a table.

# Lakeview Tavern

Upon entering the Lakeview Tavern visitors are seized by the grand view out of the enormous windows looking out onto the great valley below. Through them one can see the impenetrable sea of fog and the great mountain in the distance. By stepping closer to the windows on the back wall, the view expands so one can see down to the namesake lake and the river sired by it, its rough waters tumbling down the hills and cliffs before disappearing into the valley. If a visitor can wrest their attention away from the grand windows, they would notice a long bar made from wood with a deep red hue, backdropped by floor-to-ceiling shelves stocked with ales and wines. Behind the bar stands a man with a long blonde mohawk and sunburned skin who subconsciously whips his head to get his hair out of his eyes as he talks to another patron. Across the room is a low stage on which stands a goat-man with brown hair and brown beard, although both fade to gray at the ends. This satyr is playing a jaunty tune on a flute, and people are happily dancing in the open space in front of the platform. This long room is bookended on one side by a door behind the bar on which a sign hangs, reading “Employees only,” and on the other an open doorway above which reads “Rooms, 5gp.”

# Garden District

As the dirt road curves past the Lakeview Tavern and under a pair of large trees it becomes a paved cobblestone path. Short lamps on either side of the path are spaced an even 15-feet apart and light the way to where the path splits to encircle a magnificent fountain. Like spokes of a wagon wheel, the path branches off to the doors of eight ornate stone mansions with deep blue roofs. Past the fountain the path continues down toward the largest home in all of Gateside—a palatial estate with carved topiaries and water features in the front yard and wings and extensions that venture into the copse of trees framing its facade.

The door slowly creaks open, and before you stands a tall half-orc woman wearing black trousers, a black bowtie, and a dinner jacket.

# Market District

Following the road down the hill and along the cliff’s edge, you pass a chapel with magnificent stained glass and a cemetery that overlooks the valley. The buildings are packed in closer in this part of town, and people are bustling in and around their homes and businesses. You walk a couple of blocks past modest homes, some bare and some with humble gardens next to their doors, before coming to a clearing where vendors have set up colorful displays of their wares. Abundant fruits and vegetables spill out of carts, a merchant is toiling away under a tent to repair someone’s silver necklace, dried meats hang from racks next to a round reflecting pool. One building just off the square is covered in flowering vines, and customers are sipping tea and eating pastry under a trellis out front.

# Mortal Chapel

Two tall wooden doors reach up the side of the brown stone chapel. Above the doors you notice a circle of stained glass in blues, teals, and greens, and in the center of the circle is a tilted hourglass. It’s a simple enough building—the sanctuary comprises the mass at its center, and on one side extends a tall tower with a pointed steeple, while on the other is a wing with windows and a small covered entrance. Stepping through the massive doors draws you directly into the sanctuary. Intricately carved wooden beams reach up along the roofline

A dragonborn woman in a grey robe tied with a rope belt is on her knees scrubbing the tile between the pews. Otherwise the room is empty.

Centuries ago, this land knew only abundance. The mighty Sozarb River flowed down from the Great Peak, and brought life to the valley. The trees grew tall and the game seemed limitless, and the blessing of the Sozarb’s waters was accepted with humility. That is, until a group of outsiders washed up on our shores and convinced our ancestors to pass beyond the infinite falls and venture to the source of the Sozarb. There they discovered a great power, but their arrogance and avarice angered the Goddess Tallison, who unleashed a terrible power upon the world. A horrible demon was released and tore along the banks of the river, laying waste to the people of valley on its way to destroy the once great city of Nobylon where the river met the sea.

To protect the people from this great evil, we ask for forgiveness from the Goddess Tallison, and we obey the 3 pillars of the Mortal Church.

3 Pillars:

- Pray to the Great Peak every day
- Bathe in the lower Sozarb annually
- Respect the Goddess’s domain

# The Grove

Roughly assembled wooden shacks crowd along the edge of the cliff below Gateside. There are no roads or clear boundaries, but the homes are arranged in rough circles around large bonfire pits filled with ash.

A series of ladders are bolted to the cliff in a zigzagging pattern connecting small ledges where a climber could get a short respite.

[[Brevvis Toorb]] is running up and down the ladders with a basket tied to his back full of produce.

The fields surrounding the Grove are heavily cultivated--up the mountainside rise fields of wheat and vegetables and descending down into the valley a road passes under tall orchards.
